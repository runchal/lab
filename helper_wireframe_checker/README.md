# Wireframe to Data

This project is a tool to take a wireframe screenshot and overlay pixel coordinates on it. This helps AI-powered web development by providing the precise location of elements, similar to the data a developer would get from Figma.

## How to Use

1.  **Place your wireframe screenshot in the `assets/` directory.**
2.  **Run the application from your terminal:**

    ```bash
    python main.py <path_to_your_image>
    ```

3.  **The processed image will be saved in the `output/` directory.**

## Future Features

*   Automated Component Detection
*   Color Palette Extraction
*   Interactive GUI
*   Code Snippet Generation
*   Integration with Design Tools
